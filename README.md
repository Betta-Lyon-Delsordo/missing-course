# The Missing Course

A [University of Montana](https://umt.edu) course covering helpful software
development tools and techniques based on [The Missing
Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu).

## Schedule

The [topics/](topics/) directory contains the materials we will cover. It is
organized into topics and each topic will generally take about a week. Keep in
mind, however, that many topics will build on one another. This means that you
really don't want to fall behind. If you miss a week, be sure to catch up.

  1. [Shell Overview](topics/01-shell-overview/)
  2. [Shell Scripting](topics/02-shell-scripting/)
  3. [Shell Tools](topics/03-shell-tools/)

## Instruction

Lectures will be delivered electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Office
hours will be held virtually in an on-demand fashion. Email the instructor to
schedule an appointment. The instructor is also available on Microsoft Teams
(see below).

Assuming no technology issues, lectures will be recorded and posted on the
course web site and/or Moodle.

## Assignments

Students will submit each assignment by creating a "pull request" (PR) against
this GitHub repository. Don't worry, we'll learn what that means before anything
is due. This pattern will simulate a standard software development workflow.
You can think of it as one big, semester-long group project.

Assignments can be found in their respective [topics/](topics/) directory.

## Prerequisites

### Linux on Windows

It is possible to install a Linux distribution under Windows 10 using WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux). This will be required for some of the topics we
study during this course. See the link below for instructions.

## Grading

Assignments will be evaluated automatically or by the instructor and grades will
be posted on the course's Moodle page for confidentiality.
