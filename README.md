# The Missing Course

A [University of Montana](https://umt.edu) course about helpful software
development tools and techniques based on [The Missing
Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu).

## Schedule

TBD

## Instruction

Lectures will be delivered electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Office
hours will be held virtually in an on-demand fashion. Email the instructor to
schedule an appointment. The instructor is also available on Microsoft Teams
(see below).

## Assignments

Students will submit each assignment by creating a "pull request" (PR) against
this GitHub repository. Don't worry, we'll learn what that means before anything
is due. This pattern will simulate a standard software development workflow.
You can think of it as one big, semester-long group project.

## Grading

Assignments will be evaluated automatically or by the instructor and grades will
be posted on the course's Moodle page for confidentiality.

## Instructor

[George Lesica](https://lesica.com) is a Senior Software Scientist in the
[Wheeler Lab](https://wheelerlab.org) at the University of Montana and a
freelance software development and technology consultant.
