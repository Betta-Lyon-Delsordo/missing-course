<h1 id="the-missing-course">The Missing Course</h1>
<p>A <a href="https://umt.edu">University of Montana</a> course about helpful software development tools and techniques based on <a href="https://missing.csail.mit.edu">The Missing Semester</a>.</p>
<h2 id="schedule">Schedule</h2>
<p>The <a href="topics/">topics/</a> directory contains the materials we will cover. It is organized into topics and each topic will generally take about a week. Keep in mind, however, that many topics will build on one another. This means that you really don’t want to fall behind. If you miss a week, be sure to catch up.</p>

<li><a href="topics/01-shell-overview/">Shell Overview</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="instruction">Instruction</h2>
<p>Lectures will be delivered electronically due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Office hours will be held virtually in an on-demand fashion. Email the instructor to schedule an appointment. The instructor is also available on Microsoft Teams (see below).</p>
<h2 id="assignments">Assignments</h2>
<p>Students will submit each assignment by creating a “pull request” (PR) against this GitHub repository. Don’t worry, we’ll learn what that means before anything is due. This pattern will simulate a standard software development workflow. You can think of it as one big, semester-long group project.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<p>Assignments will be evaluated automatically or by the instructor and grades will be posted on the course’s Moodle page for confidentiality.</p>
<h2 id="instructor">Instructor</h2>
