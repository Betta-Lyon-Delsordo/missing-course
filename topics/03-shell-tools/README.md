There exists a plethora of useful command line tools. We're going to take a look
at a few that are likely to be helpful as you work your way through school and
begin a career as a computer scientist or software developer.

## History

Remember that complicated command you used to do that complicated thing the
other day? Yeah, no one does. That's why we have `Ctrl-R`. This allows you to
easily find a command you've run in the past to (optionally) edit and run again.

There is also a command called `history` that will simply print a list of your
past commands. This can be useful if you want to copy-paste commands into a
document or otherwise make use of your history in ways other than running a
single command.
