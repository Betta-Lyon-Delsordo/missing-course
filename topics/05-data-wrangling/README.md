## Regular Expressions

## Sed

## Awk

## JSON (jq)

## CSV (csvkit and csvtk)

Comma-separated values files are very common in data analysis. Think of them as
very simple Excel spreadsheets that just hold data and don't do any processing
or calculations. This simplicity is one reason for the popularity of the format,
since CSV files can be read easily on virtually any platform.

We will look at two different tools for working with CSV data on the command
line, but keep in mind that CSV files can also be loaded into ordinary
spreadsheet applications, even Excel!
